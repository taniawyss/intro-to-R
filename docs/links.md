## R for Data Science Book

Book (2nd edition) by Hadley Wickham (a very active R developer), Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund. The book makes heavy use of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse packages.

You can also have a look at ggplot2's [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/vignettes/ggplot2.html). 

The [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org/) includes code to create graphs with both the base `graphics` package as well as `ggplot2`.

Finally, this cheatsheet is also useful and gives a nice overview !

## R Markdown

A useful resource is [RStudio's R Markdown tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

For tweaking your reports, such as chosing different output formats, or hiding or showing the code within the report, we recommend that you consult the R markdown documentation provided in this [Definite guide eBook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).


## Cheatsheets

Several [cheatsheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) available for different packages, eg R Markdown, ggplot2, RStudio,...
