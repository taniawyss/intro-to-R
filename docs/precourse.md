## R and RStudio

### Technical

This course will be streamed via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/), you are thus required to have your own computer with an internet connection.
Please, install the latest the version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), followed by the installation of the free version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

At some point during the course, we will install R packages from within RStudio. This requires RStudio to access online repositories of packages and download them from the internet. Please ensure that this will not be blocked by firewalls.
